## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- ðŸ”¢ **Forecasting Engine (Python):**  
  Uses regression and time-series models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict quarterly expenses.  

- ðŸ“ˆ **Variance Analysis:**  
  Compares actual vs forecasted spending to identify budget deviations and trend anomalies.  

- ðŸ’¡ **Interactive Power BI Dashboard:**  
  Displays financial KPIs, expense categories, and variance trends with dynamic slicers and filters.  

- ðŸ§° **Automated ETL Workflow:**  
  Cleans and transforms financial data for seamless integration into Power BI.
