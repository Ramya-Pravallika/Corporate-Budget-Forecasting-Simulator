# 🧮 Corporate Budget Forecasting Simulator

## 📘 Project Overview  
The **Corporate Budget Forecasting Simulator** is a data-driven financial planning tool that leverages **Python** and **Power BI** to forecast quarterly spending, monitor variance, and improve budget accuracy.  
Using historical financial data, it applies **time-series regression models** to predict future expenditures, enabling finance teams to make informed, data-backed budget decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- 🔢 **Forecasting Engine (Python):**  
  Uses regression and time-series models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict quarterly expenses.  

- 📈 **Variance Analysis:**  
  Compares actual vs forecasted spending to identify budget deviations and trend anomalies.  

- 💡 **Interactive Power BI Dashboard:**  
  Displays financial KPIs, expense categories, and variance trends with dynamic slicers and filters.  

- 🧰 **Automated ETL Workflow:**  
  Cleans and transforms financial data for seamless integration into Power BI.  

- 📊 **Accuracy Boost:**  
  Improved overall **budget prediction accuracy by 18%** using data-driven insights.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Cleans raw financial data (outlier removal, missing value imputation).  
2. **Model Training:**  
   Applies time-series regression to forecast future spending by cost center and department.  
3. **Variance Computation:**  
   Calculates forecasted vs actual variance at quarterly intervals.  
4. **Visualization:**  
   Power BI dashboard displays key metrics:  
   - Budget vs Actual Spending  
   - Forecast Accuracy  
   - Top 5 Variance Drivers  
   - Trend Forecast (next 4 quarters)

## 📊 Sample Insights  
- Q2 spending was **12% below forecast** due to deferred capital projects.  
- Marketing and IT departments contributed to **68% of total variance**.  
- Forecast accuracy improved from **76% to 90%** after model retraining.
